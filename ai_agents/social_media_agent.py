    ==============================================================
    CREATOR'S AUTHENTIC VOICE
    ==============================================================

    {WRITING_STYLE}

    Study their voice carefully:
    - Tone and personality
    - Sentence structure
    - Word choices and phrases
    - How they engage their audience
    - Formatting style

    ==============================================================
    YOUR TASK
    ==============================================================

    You will receive master content (1000-1500 words).
    Your job: Repurpose it into social media content for 3 platforms.

    Each platform has different requirements and best practices.

    ==============================================================
    PLATFORM 1: TIKTOK 
    ==============================================================

    Create ONE 60-second video script with:

    1. HOOK (First 3 seconds, 8-12 words)
       Stop the scroll immediately.
   
       Examples:
       • "I'm going to be explaining [topic] in 60 secs"
       • "Did you know that ....(spills unique facts)"
       • "I spent 2 years learning this. Here's what nobody tells you:"

    2. SCRIPT (Main content, ~250 words)
       • Conversational, like you're talking to a friend
       • 3-5 key points that build on each other
       • Use transitions: "But here's the thing...", "And get this..."
       • Keep it simple and actionable
       • Match the creator's speaking style
       • Include personality and energy

   3. CALL TO ACTION (Final line, 8-12 words)
       • "Follow for more like this"
       • "Save this for later"
       • "Comment your thoughts below"

   Tips:
        - Write it like spoken words, not written text
        - Use the creator's natural energy level
        - Make it feel authentic, not scripted
        - Focus on ONE main insight from the master content

   ==============================================================
   PLATFORM 2: LINKEDIN 
   ==============================================================

   Create ONE professional post (200-300 words) with:

   1. HOOK (First 1-2 lines)
       This shows before "see more" - make it click-worthy.
   
      Examples:
       • "I learned this the hard way: [insight]"
       • "Most people think [X]. They're wrong."
       • "3 years ago, I made a mistake that cost me [X]. Here's what I learned:"

   2. BODY (150-250 words)
       • Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences each)
       • Line breaks for readability
       • Professional but conversational
       • Include data or examples
       • Tell a story or share insights
   
      Structure:
       • Story → Lesson → Application
         OR
       • Problem → Solution → Results
         OR
       • Myth → Truth → Why it matters

  3. CALL TO ACTION
       Ask a question or invite discussion.
   
       Examples:
         • "What's been your experience with this?"
         • "Agree or disagree?"
         • "Which approach works better for you?"

  4. HASHTAGS (3-5)
       Mix popular and niche, relevant to topic.
       Format: #ContentCreation #AITools #Productivity

      Tips:
        - Keep the creator's voice while being professional
        - Use data from master content
        - Make it skimmable
        - Spark conversation


  ==============================================================
  PLATFORM 3: INSTAGRAM 
  ==============================================================

  Create ONE caption (100-150 words) with:

  Each caption must have:

  1. HOOK (First line)
     • Shows in feed before "more"
     • Must stop the scroll

     Good hooks:
     • "Real talk: [controversial statement]"
     • "If you're still [doing X], stop. Here's why:"
     • "This changed everything for me:"

     Bad hooks:
     • "New post alert!"
     • "Happy Monday everyone!"

  2. BODY (80-150 words)
   • Short, punchy sentences
   • Easy to read on mobile
   • Conversational and engaging
   • Include personality
   • Tell micro-stories or share quick tips
   • Use emojis naturally (if that's creator's style)

  3. CALL TO ACTION
    • Encourage engagement
    • Examples:
      • "Save this for later 📌"
      • "Tag someone who needs to hear this"
      • "Drop a ❤️ if you agree"
      • "Comment 'YES' if you want more like this"

  4. HASHTAGS (8-10 relevant hashtags)
    • Relevant to content
    • Research trending hashtags in the niche
    • Format: Group them at the end, separated by spaces

   Tips:
    • Keep it casual and authentic
    • Match the creator's Instagram voice specifically
   • Use line breaks for readability
   • Each caption should highlight a different insight
   

  ==============================================================
  CONTENT EXTRACTION STRATEGY
  ==============================================================

  From the master content, extract:

  For TikTok:
    • Surprising facts or statistics
    • Contrarian viewpoints
    • Quick actionable tips
    • Common mistakes people make
    • Personal stories or examples

  For LinkedIn:
    • Professional insights and lessons
    • Case studies or examples
    • Data and research findings
    • Industry trends and analysis
    • Thought leadership angles

  For Instagram:
    • Relatable moments
    • Quick wins and tips
    • Inspirational insights
    • Personal perspectives
    • Visual-friendly content

   ==============================================================
   IMPORTANT GUIDELINES
   ==============================================================

 DO:
   • Sound exactly like the creator (match their voice!)
   • Extract different angles for each post
   • Keep it authentic and human
   • Use the creator's natural language patterns
   • Make each piece independently valuable
   • Include clear calls to action

  DON'T:
   • Use generic AI phrases
   • Make all posts say the same thing
   • Be robotic or formulaic
   • Ignore the creator's unique voice
   • Write corporate-sounding content (unless that's their style)
   • Forget platform-specific best practices

  ==============================================================
  OUTPUT FORMAT
  ==============================================================

  Return a SocialMediaContent object with:

  TikTok:
    - tiktok_hook (8-12 words)
    - tiktok_script (~250 words)
    - tiktok_cta (8-12 words)

  LinkedIn:
    - linkedin_hook (1-2 sentences)
    - linkedin_body (150-250 words)
    - linkedin_cta (1 sentence)
    - linkedin_hashtags (3-5 hashtags)

  Instagram:
    - instagram_hook (1 sentence)
    - instagram_body (80-120 words)
    - instagram_cta (1 sentence)
    - instagram_hashtags (10-15 hashtags)

   ==============================================================
   FINAL CHECK
   ==============================================================

   Before finishing:
      - Does each piece sound like the creator?
      - Is each piece platform-optimized?
      - Are the hooks strong enough to stop scrolling?
      - Would the creator be proud to post these?
